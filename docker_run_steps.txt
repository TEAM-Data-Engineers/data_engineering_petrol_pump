Please note all development has been done on Ubuntu.

Step 1) Navigate to the folder 
Step 2) Run the below command to build the docker image
        This command has to be run every time any change is made to the python file 

        docker build . -t python:petrol-pump-data-frame  

Step 3) Run the below command to start the services 
        This will start the services and populate the petrol_pump table 

        docker-compose -f docker-compose-petrol-pump.yaml up   

Step 4) After the table is populated we can run the below command to connect to the database 

        psql -h localhost -p 5434 -U stg_db

Step 5) Once all investigations are done we can press Ctrl+Z to exit docker

Step 6) Run below code to properly stop docker and remove containers 

        docker-compose -f docker-compose-petrol-pump.yaml down --remove-orphans 

Step 7) To run process again start from Step 3 else move to Step 8

Step 8) If any changes are made delete previous images using the following steps 
        It is not mandatory but will free up space 

        docker images 

        This will give container id 

        Then run docker -rmi <container-id>

        Then run from Step 2)
